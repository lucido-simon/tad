= How to manage authentication using an OIDC =

== Introduction ==

Let's break down this problem by first understanding important concepts that surrounds authentication, OIDC - and by extension, authorization and the Keycloak vocabulary. 

=== What is authentication? ===

Most of today's systems defines personalized behavior based on who is using the application. Think of a bank application, you want to see your accounts and transactions, but you don't want to see someone else's !
To be able to do this, the application needs to know who you are. This is what authentication is. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user.

This process can be done in a myriad, but the most common ways the end user is going to identify themselves is by providing a username and password. Or by using a third party service, like Facebook or Google, to identify themselves. 

Those third party service, like Facebook or Google, are called identity providers (IdP). There are multiples types of them, the most common being OpenID Connect (OIDC) and SAML. 

This question is about OIDC, so I'm not going to go into details about SAML. OIDC is gaining in popularity, thanks to its use of JSON which make it much more easier to work with with nowadays solutions, while the older SAML protocol is XML based. SAML is still widely used, but mostly in enterprise environments.

=== What is authorization? ===

Let's take our bank example a step further. When logging in, you want to see your accounts and transactions, but you don't want anybody else to see them ! This is what authorization is. Authorization is the process of verifying what a user is allowed to do.

To do so, whenever a user is taking an action which requires a level of authorization, the application is going to check whether the user actually have the right to do so. 

=== OpenID Connect ===

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a identity layer build on top of OAuth2. It allows to authenticate users using an Authorization Server (AS) and to get information about the user, using a REST-like manner. 

The main participants are :

* The end user, which is the entity that is going to authenticate. They are the equivalent of the resource owner in OAuth2, and one of the resource they own is their identity.
* The Relying Party (RP), or client, which is the application that is going to use the identity of the end user. They rely on the OpenID Provider (OP) to authenticate the end user.
* The OpenID Provider (OP), which is the entity that is going to authenticate the end user. They are an authorization server in OAuth2. They provide the identity of the end user to the relying party. The identity may contains information about the user, like their name, email, etc..
* The Resource Server, which owns the resource that the end user or client is going to access. They trusts the Authorization Server (the OIDC Provider), and will check the token provided by the OP to verify the client was given access to the resource. A Resource Server may be in the same system as the Authorization Server.

This data is exchanged using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT are a way to encode data in a compact way, using JSON. They are usually signed using an asymmetric algorithm, and can be verified using a public key.

The main token used in the OIDC protocol is the ID Token. It contains information about the user, and is signed by the OP. It is the ID Card of the OIDC protocol.

Another type of token used in the OAuth2 protocol (which is used in OIDC since it's a superset), is the access token. It is used by the client application to access the resource owner's (the end user) resources. This token is usually short lived, and a new one can be obtain using a refresh token in most authentication flows. An access token is tied to a client, and defines the scopes and resources the client is allowed to access.

In most flows, the user is also given a refresh token. Since access token are short lived, refresh token provides a way to refresh them, as its name indicate.

=== Keycloak ===

Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution that provides a centralized platform for managing authentication and authorization for applications and services. It offers a range of features and capabilities, including support for a wide range of authentication mechanisms and protocols, user management and provisioning, and integration with third-party systems.

Keycloak is built on top of the WildFly application server and uses the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) standards for authentication and authorization. This allows applications to verify the identity of users through a third-party identity provider (IdP), such as Keycloak, and securely access resources on behalf of users without requiring them to share their credentials.

It provides a web-based administration console that allows administrators to manage users, roles, and applications, as well as configure authentication and authorization settings. It also offers a range of customization options, such as custom themes and branding, to tailor the user experience for specific applications or organizations.

Keycloak is designed to be highly scalable and can handle millions of users and thousands of applications. It is easy to deploy and can be integrated with a wide range of applications and services, including web, mobile, and single-page applications. Overall, Keycloak provides a comprehensive solution for managing user authentication and authorization in modern applications and services.

==== Keycloak terminology ====

Keycloak has its own vocabulary of terms and concepts that are important to understand in order to effectively use and configure the platform. Some key terms and concepts in Keycloak include:

* *Realm*: A realm is a logical partition in Keycloak that represents a separate security domain. Each realm has its own set of users, roles, and applications, and can have its own authentication and authorization policies.

* *User*: A user is an individual who is registered in Keycloak and can authenticate to access applications and services. Users are associated with one or more realms and can be assigned different roles within each realm.

* *Role*: A role is a collection of permissions that can be assigned to users. Roles are defined at the realm level and can be used to control access to different resources and applications within a realm.

* *Client*: A client is an application or service that is registered in Keycloak and can authenticate users. Clients can be public or confidential, depending on whether they can securely store and manage their own secrets.

* *Protocol*: Keycloak supports a range of authentication protocols, such as OAuth 2.0, SAML, and OpenID Connect (OIDC), which define the messages and flows used to authenticate users and access resources.

* *Identity provider (IdP)*: An identity provider is a service that provides authentication and identity information for users. In Keycloak, the Keycloak server itself acts as an IdP, allowing applications to verify the identity of users through the Keycloak IdP.

* *Access token*: An access token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is issued by the Keycloak server and used to authenticate and authorize access to protected resources. Access tokens contain information about the user and the permissions they have been granted.

* *Scope*: A scope is a collection of permissions that can be associated with an access token. Scopes define the specific resources and actions that a user is allowed to access and perform.

* *Federation*: Federation is the process of connecting Keycloak to other identity providers, such as social media or enterprise directories, to allow users to authenticate using their existing credentials. This allows users to log in to applications using a single set of credentials, without the need for each application to manage its own authentication processes.

Understanding these terms and concepts is essential for using and configuring Keycloak effectively.

== Keycloak and Polycode ==

As of the right now, Polycode defines and runs it's own implementation of a basic OAuth2 server, implementing only the direct grant flow. It is running on the same application that also is the resource server.

It's important to realize that, as our API becomes a Resource Server, accessing it requires authentication, even inside the Polycode application. 

The goal is to replace this implementation with one using Keycloak, and its OIDC capabilities. We will slightly touch on some migration steps, but the main goal is to have an high level overview of the architecture.

=== Architecture Diagram ===

We will discuss how we can integrate OIDC in Polycode. As of right now, Polycode still follows a monolithic approach. However, as discussed in the previous chapter, there is a clear path to split the application in multiple microservices. Although this is a significant change in the architecture, I think we can simplify the relationship between the different components of the OAuth2 flow. Indeed, in practice, an API Gateway or a shared library between our microservices will handle the authentication. One will run only in one application, and the other will run on multiples services, but since the code that will handle the authentication will be the same, we can for simplicity sake, consider that the authentication will be handled by only one application. I will refer to this application as the "Polycode API" throughout this chapter, whatever the implementation.

I think this approach is justifiable, since I want to focus on the core concepts behind OIDC (and AuthN / AuthZ in general). What I want to show throughout this chapter is the flow of data between the different actors, and the different responsibilities of each actor. The Polycode API, will be a Resource Server and an Client application, whatever how the application is break down.

With that out of the way, let's have a look at the architecture schema:

=== Deployment Diagram ===

We have seen all the elements of our architecture, but we still need to know how they are deployed. This is an important step in the design of our architecture, since it will impact performance, security, scalability and resilience.

First of all, we need to understand that our IdP (Keycloak) is not directly linked to Polycode. Although the API is the only client of the IdP, this might change in the future. We can imagine using this Keycloak for all Polytech related projects for example. Keycloak becomes a dependency of our API, but it is not part of our API. 

We that in mind, I think it's a good idea to deploy Keycloak in a separate system. This will allow us to scale it independently from the API, and to have a clear separation of concerns, which will allow us to take down the API without impacting other future users of our IdP.
We can see in the following diagram how this is realized. The Keycloak is deployed in its own server, with its own database. It is an independent system that doesn't rely on the API deployment infrastructure.

Just like the current implementation of Polycode, all the services of Polycode are deployed in a single Kubernetes cluster, composed of multiple nodes (only one node is shown in the diagram for simplicity). I've made the decision to use SaaS services for the databases, to off-load the time and risks associated with managing its own database. We could use self-hosted database, but this would require more maintenance and would be less resilient. This, however, has performance and cost implications. 

Performance will be greatly impacted, since the database will be hosted in a different location the the API, which is currently hosted at Polytech. By doing this, we are increasing delays by orders of magnitude. This is a trade-off I'm willing to make, and migrating back and forth to a self-hosted database is not a huge task (but still needs careful thinking), just like migrating the current infrastructure to the cloud.

As shown in the diagram, the Keycloak will be accessible from the internet, just like the API and the Frontend. It is necessary but it is important to recognize that this is a security risk. We need to make sure that the Keycloak is properly secured, and that we don't expose any sensitive information. 

Just like like in the previous diagram, the API is a simplification of what actually runs. This is still justifiable, since all micro-services and gateways will be running in the same cluster, and in the same namespace.

=== Sequence Diagrams ===
[#auth-code-flow]
==== General authentication flow: the code flow ====

This diagram sequence presents the authorization code flow, a way of granting access to a web application using an authorization code. This flow is often used in the context of OIDC. In the authorization code flow, the user is first redirected to the IdP to authenticate. The IdP then redirects the user to the provided redirect URI, with an authorization code. This code can then be sent to the API that will exchange the code for an access and ID token. This access token can be used to access protected resources, by the API, on behalf of the user.

The authorization code flow provides several benefits over other authentication flows. It allows the user to authenticate without sharing their credentials with the API, and it allows the API to verify the user's identity without having to store the user's credentials. Additionally, the use of an authorization code adds an extra layer of security, as the code can only be exchanged for an access token by the intended recipient.

The authorization code flow is commonly used in modern web and mobile applications to securely access user data from a third-party service. In the case of Keycloak, the IdP is responsible for authenticating the user and managing their identity information, while the web application and API can focus on providing a great user experience and accessing protected resources on behalf of the user. The future diagrams in this sequence will describe different ways to connect to the application using this flow, such as connecting with a Google, Polytech or vanilla account.

Once the API has exchanged the code for the tokens, it should create a mapping between its Session ID and the tokens. This Session ID will be used by the web Application to authenticate its requests to the API.

Implementing this can be done in multiple ways. The API can use a shared, fast database such a Redis or Memcached, since the data stored should be indexed by a simple key, with no need for relationship. TTL would also be useful, since each entry could be set to expire at the time the tokens expire. By doing so, we keep our API stateless, and scalability is not impacted.

We can also think about creating a gateway that would be responsible for this mapping. In a microservice world, it is out of the scope of each microservice to map cookies with tokens, and should be off-loaded to a gateway. This gateway could also be used to implement rate limiting, observability, and other features that are not directly related to the business logic of the API.

==== User creates an account, vanilla ====
The following diagram shows the process of creating a vanilla account on Polycode. We can see that the user is redirected to Keycloak to create an account and provide their email address and password. The IDP will then check for email duplication, validity, and password strength to ensure that the user's account is secure.

Once the user has created their account, the IDP will send a verification email to the user, which the user must click on to confirm their email address. Once the user's email address has been verified, they can use their vanilla account to log in to the web application and access protected resources on the web application on behalf of the user.

The next diagram will describe how the user can use their vanilla account to log in to the web application and access protected resources.

==== User logs in, vanilla ====
This diagram sequence demonstrates how the user can log into Polycode using a vanilla account. The user is redirected to the IDP, where they can enter their email address and password. The IDP will then verify the user's credentials and redirect the user to the web application, with an authorization code. The authorization code flow is described in a xref:auth-code-flow[previous diagram].

==== User creates an account or logs in, via Polytech LDAP ====
In the following sequence diagram, the user logs in into Polycode using its Polytech LDAP account. The user is redirected to the IDP, where they can enter their Polytech LDAP credentials. If it's the first time the user connects to Polycode, a new entry will be made in the Keycloak database. Keycloak needs to do this in order to store information that are needed in the OIDC context. Since we are likely to be limited to a read-only access to the LDAP, we also need to store everything the user might edit later on. Storing in the local database also allows for caching, which will speed up all requests that needs to check for a LDAP linked user.

It is worth noting that Keycloak will always validate the user password using the LDAP, and delegates the storage of the password to. This is done to ensure that the user's password is always up to date, and synchronized with the LDAP.

The IdP will then verify the user's credentials and redirect the user to the web application, with an authorization code. The authorization code flow is described in a xref:auth-code-flow[previous diagram].

==== User creates an account or logs in, via Google ====
In this diagram, we will be demonstrating the process of connecting to an application using a Google account. This process is becoming increasingly popular among users as it allows them to easily and securely access multiple applications using a single set of credentials.

Since Google is an external identity provider, the user will be redirected to the Google login page, where they can enter their Google credentials. Google also uses OIDC, so the user will be redirected to an OIDC endpoint, with a authorization code. The authorization code flow will then be used to exchange the authorization code for an access token and ID token. Keycloak automates this process.

If it's the first time the user logs in using Google, a new entry in the Keycloak database will be created. This entry will contain the user's Google ID, which will be used to identify the user in the future. 

The user will then be redirected to the web application, with an authorization code. The authorization code flow is described in a xref:auth-code-flow[previous diagram].

==== User links its Polycode account to its Google account ====

A user that created an vanilla account on Polycode might also want to log in via its Google account. This is possible if both uses the same mail address. This is what this sequence diagram describes.

In this case, when logging in, the user will be able to edit its profile before linking its Google account. The user then need to verify that he is the owner of the Google account by clicking on a link sent to his email address. Once the user has verified his email address, the user will be redirected to the web application, with an xref:auth-code-flow[authorization code].

=== Proof of concept ===
Now that we have a deeper understanding of how I suggest handling authentication in the Polycode context by using keycloak as our OIDC, I have made a sample proof of concept that implements some of the describes flow shown above.

You can find the repository https://github.com/polycode-lucido/oidc-poc[here], and an already deployed environment https://poly-code.com[here]. To sum up what this PoC does in a few lines:

* Our IdP is keycloak
* Our client and resource server is the backend
* The user delegates access to its information to the backend using OAuth2
* The user stays logged in using a cookie session
* Authorization is handled at the keycloak level

They are some lacking features and shortcuts:
* Authorization is not as fined-grained as we have in the existing polycode
* Mapping between cookie and JWTs is not done on a database, meaning we can't have replicas for the API
* Is a bit buggy

This is a PoC and I think it demonstrates nicely that my implementation can be made to work pretty easily.

== Conclusion ==
We discovered authentication, authorization and OIDC. We looked what keycloak was and how we can make use of it for Polycode, by using as our IdP. I would like, as an opener for this section, to discuss a bit more about how we could use this new keycloak instance. Indeed, this keycloak would only be used by polycode for now, but nothing is guarding us from using it for something else. Effectively, this keycloak could become our main IdP for all our future projects, federating users from Polytech's LDAP, Github and Google accounts and vanilla accounts. We must not see keycloak as being part of the Polycode system, but like Polycode system being reliant on keycloak to provide authentication and authorization capabilities. This opens up a pretty wide range of possibilities for future projects, or existing one who would want to integrate our user-base.
