= Security =

== Introduction ==
In the previous sections, we addressed a lot of subjects related to microservices and Polycode. However, there is a very important aspect of all compute systems that we haven't talked about yet (or very little): security. In this section, I'm going to have a deeper look into securing our system, in a world where cyber-security attacks are done at a massive scale, and where malicious users and bad actors are more and more proactive.

=== What even is security ? ===
Security, in the context of a web application with a microservice backend, refers to a set of practices and technologies that are used to protect the application and its users from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

Each deployed services has its own set of responsibilities and are ran in its own isolated environment. This architecture requires a different approach to security than a traditional monolithic application, as it requires coordination between multiple teams and a focus on securing individual services rather than the entire system. Security happens at multiple levels in our architecture:

* At the frontend
* At the backend
* At the operation level
* In the communication between all our actors

Security is not as simple as implementing something somewhere, and your system becomes secure. It requires an accurate understanding of how your system interacts. A team with a security mindset leads to a secure system, since every task, implementation, deployment and configuration have security concerns coming with it. Security should be a concern that every member working on a project should have. Security should be an integral part of the development and deployment process for any web application.

There is also no definitive way to have a 100% secure system. 0-risk doesn't exist, and it is important to realize that. With this fact in mind, the general objective changes. It becomes about reducing the surface of attack of your system, careful monitoring and auditing of your system and having well-defined incident response plan in case of an emergency.

=== Why is security important ? ===
Now that we have a better understanding about what security is, let's talk about why is security important. I'm going to assume that we are a company and not an educational project.

Security is important for several reasons:

* Protection of sensitive data: Security measures protects sensitive information, such as personal data, financial information, and confidential business information, from unauthorized access or breaches.
* Compliance: Many industries have regulations that require organizations to implement certain security measures to protect sensitive data, such as GDPR. Compliance with these regulations is important to avoid fines and reputational damage.
* Business continuity: Security measures helps making the organization's operations continuous in the event of a security incident. This includes disaster recovery plans, backups and other mechanisms to ensure the availability of systems and data.
* Protecting against cyber threats: Security measures help protect against cyber attacks, such as malware, which can cause data loss, system downtime, and more.
* Trust and reputation: Security is essential to building trust with customers, partners and stakeholders. It's important for organizations to be transparent about their security measures and to demonstrate that they take security seriously.
* Protecting intellectual property: Security measures help protect an organization's intellectual property, such as trade secrets, patents, trademarks or the codebase from theft or unauthorized use.

Let's get back in the context of Polycode. I'm going to talk about the biggest security concerns that we might encounter, categorized in 3 categories: frontend, backend and operation.

== Frontend security ==
Let's discuss security matters that relates to the frontend. When I talk about the frontend, I refer with the website that the user is going to interacts with, and how this website is interacting with our backend.

=== Cross-site scripting (XSS Attacks) ===
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of security vulnerability that allow attackers to inject malicious code into a web page viewed by other users. The malicious code, usually in the form of a script, is executed by the browser, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, such as user login credentials, or perform other malicious actions, such as redirecting the user to a phishing site.

There are two main types of XSS attacks:

* Stored XSS: where the attacker injects malicious code into a web page that is then stored on the server and served to all users who visit the page.
* Reflected XSS: where the attacker injects malicious code into a web page by tricking a user into clicking on a link or submitting a form that contains the code. The code is then reflected back to the user's browser and executed.

To prevent XSS attacks, you can:

* Validate input: Validate all user input to make sure that it does not contain any malicious code. Use a whitelist approach to only allow known good input, rather than trying to identify bad input. This should be applied where it makes sense, we don't want to invalidate Javascript code in our Javascript playgrounds.
* Encode output: Any user input that is displayed on a web page must be properly encoded to prevent the browser from interpreting it as code.
* Use content security policy (CSP): CSP is a security feature that helps prevent XSS attacks by specifying which sources of content are allowed to be loaded by the browser.
* Use `HttpOnly` cookies. This prevents any malicious Javascript from accessing the cookies set by the web page.

=== Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) ===
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks tricks the user into performing an unintended action, such as transferring funds or changing their password, by tricking the user into clicking on a malicious link or submitting a form. The attacker takes advantage of the user's authenticated session with the web application to perform the action on the user's behalf.

Here are the main ways to prevent CSRF attacks:

* Use of anti-CSRF tokens: This is the most common method to prevent CSRF attacks. The server generates a unique token and sends it to the client as a hidden field in a form (hardly applies to us since we are using NextJS) or as a cookie. The token must then be included in any subsequent requests that modify data on the server.
* Same-site cookies: This is a browser-based security feature that prevents a web application from sending a user's cookies to a different site. This helps prevent an attacker from tricking the user into visiting a malicious site that then sends a request to the web application using the user's cookies.
* Use of the `referrer` header: This method involves checking the `referrer` header on the server to ensure that the request was made from the same site as the web application.

=== Browser storage attacks ===
Browser storage attacks occur when an attacker is able to exploit a vulnerability in the way that a web application stores data in the browser to gain access to sensitive data. The most common types of browser storage are cookies, local storage, session storage, and IndexedDB.

The main way to secure the data you store on the end user's user agent is to encrypt the data. This prevents an attacker from being able to read the data if they are able to access it. You should also regularly audit your code by reviewing it to make sure that data is stored and accessed securely and that sensitive data is not stored unnecessarily.

=== Man-in-the-middle attacks ===
Man-in-the-middle attacks are a category of attacks that can be performed to the data while it is transiting over the network. 

The most commons attacks are:

* Packet sniffing: an attacker listens to the packets transiting on the network, allowing him to steal credentials or perform replays attacks.
* Malicious code injection: an attack inject a malicious script to the website that is being visited, or can send its own phishing site altogether.

To prevent this kind of attacks, you should:

* Use an encrypted communication protocol (HTTPS), making it much more difficult to intercept and read the data in transit.
* Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS): this technique allows a website to tell the browser that it should only be accessed over HTTPS and not HTTP. This prevents an attacker from intercepting a HTTPS connection and downgrading it to HTTP.

== Backend security ==
Securing your backend is very important, since this is where all sensitive data is handled, and the business logic is executed. Finding a breach in your backend paves the way for an attacker to gain unauthorized access to other users data, for example. In this chapter, we are going to look at the usual vector of attacks and how you can prevent them.

=== Broken access control / broken authentication ===
Some attacks rely on bypassing or exploiting weaknesses in the authorization process to gain unauthorized access to resources or perform actions that they should not be able to. This can be done by manipulating the authentication process or exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's code. In our case, we are running a Role-Based Access Policies (RBAC) authorization framework.

Authentication and authorization is a very important aspect of security. You should use robust and well-maintained tools to handle that for you, unless you can have a team with the resources necessary to audit and attack your in-house authentication and authorization engine. You should oblige to the least privilege principle, meaning that you give the bare-minimum authorization a user should have access to.

Broken access control is ranked #1 on https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/[OWASP's top ten web application security risks].

=== Cryptographic failures ===
Cryptographic failure refers to the situation when the cryptographic mechanisms used to secure a system fail to provide the level of security that was intended. This can happen due to various reasons such as weak encryption algorithms, poor key management, or implementation errors.

There are several types of cryptographic failures, including:

* Weak encryption: This occurs when the encryption algorithm used is weak and can be easily broken by an attacker.
* Poor key management: This occurs when the keys used to encrypt and decrypt data are not properly protected and can be easily obtained by an attacker.
* Implementation errors: This occurs when the cryptographic mechanisms are implemented incorrectly, leading to vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an attacker.

To prevent cryptographic failures, it's important to follow these best practices:

* Use of strong encryption algorithms: Use encryption algorithms that have been thoroughly vetted and are considered to be strong, such as AES, RSA, and ECC.
* Use of good key management: Use key management systems that provide secure key storage, key rotation, and key destruction.
* Use of tested and well-vetted cryptographic libraries: Use cryptographic libraries that have been thoroughly vetted and are considered to be secure.
* Regularly review and update encryption algorithms and key management practices to ensure that they are still considered secure.

Cryptographic failures are ranked #2 on https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/[OWASP's top ten web application security risks]

=== Injection ===
Injection attacks are a type of security vulnerability that occur when an attacker is able to inject malicious code or data into a web application, in order to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's code or in the underlying system. These attacks can be used to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, and can also be used to inject malware or perform other malicious actions.

There are several types of injection attacks, including:

* SQL injection: This type of attack involves injecting malicious SQL code into a web application to manipulate the database and steal sensitive information. This is by far the most popular type of injection.
* Command injection: This type of attack involves injecting malicious commands into a web application to execute arbitrary code on the underlying system.
* File inclusion: This type of attack involves injecting a malicious file path into a web application to include and execute arbitrary code on the underlying system.
* Header injection: This type of attack involves injecting malicious data into headers of HTTP requests

We are not vulnerable to any kind of these injections. This is due to our usage of specialized libraries (ORMs for database related payloads, which implement prepared statements or parametrized queries), that take care of securing user input.

Injection is ranked #3 on https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/[OWASP's top ten web application security risks].

=== Outdated and vulnerable software ===
Outdated and vulnerable software significantly increases security risks by making it easier for attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities. As software ages, new vulnerabilities are discovered and patches are released to address them. However, if a system is not kept up-to-date with the latest security patches, it may still be vulnerable to these known vulnerabilities. Additionally, older software may not have the same level of security features as newer versions, making it more vulnerable to attacks.

This both a concern in the backend and at the operational level. For the backend, you should:

* Keep libraries up-to-date: Regularly check for and apply the latest security patches to ensure that known vulnerabilities are addressed.
* Use an automated patch management system: Automated patch management systems can help ensure that all your dependencies are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Use a vulnerability scanner: Vulnerability scanners can help identify vulnerabilities in a system and can be used to generate reports that can be used to prioritize which vulnerabilities should be addressed first.
* Use libraries that are supported and actively maintained by the community to ensure that security patches are released in a timely manner.

Outdated and vulnerable software are ranked #6 on https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/[OWASP's top ten web application security risks].

=== Server-side request forgery (SSRF) ===
Server-side request forgery (SSRF) is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to send a request to a server from a vulnerable application, in order to access resources or perform actions that the attacker should not be able to access. This type of attack is typically used to gain unauthorized access to internal systems, such as databases or other sensitive resources, by exploiting the trust relationship between the server and the vulnerable application. This is typically done by tricking a server into sending a request to an internal service.

To prevent SSRFs attacks, you should have an overall good and secure system that checks and validates user inputs and that is protected from injections. You can also make use of WAF (Web Application Firewall) to inspect and drop any requests that doesn't match any routes, parameters and HTTP Methods known to the system.

SSRF is ranked #10 on https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/[OWASP's top ten web application security risks].

=== Man-in-the-middle attacks ===
Just like with the frontend, you need to prevent any man-in-the-middle attacks within your backend architecture. You don't know where your containers are going to be ran, meaning it might go through the internet or untrusted networks to communicate. You need to secure your backchannel properly, as it will transport all kind of sensitive information about the system and the business logic. Every request that you make could be sent across a untrusted network. To prevent that, more specifically in a Kubernetes environment, you can:

* Use service meshes that provides mTLS support (such as Istio)
* Use a 3rd-party network plugin for kubernetes that encrypts traffic between nodes out of the box https://www.weave.works/docs/net/latest/concepts/encryption/[such as WeaveNet]

All your traffic should be encrypted.

=== Input Validation ===
Input validation are not a kind of attack but more a general good practice that you always need to follow. It refers to the process of ensuring that all user input received by a web application is valid and safe to use. It is a security measure that helps to prevent malicious input from being used to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's code or in the underlying system. User input can't be trusted, and you need to treat it as such. Failing to treat properly user's input can lead to a variety of attacks, such as XSS, CSRF, SSRF or Injections of any kind.

You can validate user's input in multiple ways, depending on the context, such as checking for a valid range, correct date, password strength check and more. Validation should be done in the backend, since you can't trust what's happening in the front-end. The user might try to send a hand-made request, or the user-agent might have been compromised. Frontend validation is great for the user, since it allows to have a immediate feedback if he mistakenly did something wrong. But backend user input validation is where you really need to focus on, because this is where the security measure actually is.

== Operation security ==
The last level of security I want to talk about is at the operation layer. At this layer, we are going to talk about the way you manage your infrastructure, and not the code that is running within it. This is arguably the most important aspect of your security layer, since gaining access to a host machine usually translates to having full access to its resources and services, and usually allows the attacker to move horizontally in your system.

=== Security misconfiguration ===
The first kind of security concerns that I want to talk about is general misconfiguration. This usually takes the form of weak passwords, default accounts, open ports, incorrect permissions or letting unnecessary services running. It can lead to unauthorized access, denial of service or privilege escalation, where the attacker gain even more access to your system.

You should follow security guidelines for every of your running applications and services, and be thorough when configuring a new application on your application. What I saw happening in my (short) experience, is that people want to get a service running to try and see it running and how it behaves. They get it to work, never change the configuration again, and it end up in the production environment, publicly exposed and with poor security practices. You should discourage this kind of behavior and be very weary of what you are deploying and installing in your system, and how you do it. You should also regularly review and audit your configurations, trying to catch any misconfiguration or door left open for an attacker to come in.

Security misconfigurations are ranked #5 on https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/[OWASP's top ten web application security risks].

=== Outdated and vulnerable software ===
We've already talked about this attack vector, but it takes a different shape when we talk about it at the operational layer. Whereas in the backend, we were mostly worried about dependencies, at the operation level, we are worried about software CVEs and unpatched vulnerabilities.

You are dependent on a lot of software to run your application, and each of them might have special access to your system. No system is totally safe, as is the software you use. This is why it is important to constantly update your software, from the operating layer, to your service mesh, to ensure that no known vulnerabilities can be exploited by hackers. As an example, Wordpress is known for having a constant stream of critical CVEs, and it is of the uppermost importance install security patches as soon as they are up. However, the Wordpress community is also known to be quite slow to react to this kind of issues, and this is why a lot of Wordpress sites ends-up compromised.

The same principle applies to your Linux kernel and Kubernetes cluster for example, since they both have full-access on your machine, and if compromised, would lead to catastrophic security failures.

For your operation layer, you should:

* Keep all your software up-to-date: Regularly check for and apply the latest security patches to ensure that known vulnerabilities are addressed.
* Use an automated patch management system: Automated patch management systems can help ensure that all your dependencies are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Use a vulnerability scanner: Vulnerability scanners can help identify vulnerabilities in a system and can be used to generate reports that can be used to prioritize which vulnerabilities should be addressed first.
* Use software that are supported and actively maintained by the community or their vendor to ensure that security patches are released in a timely manner.

Outdated and vulnerable software are ranked #6 on https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/[OWASP's top ten web application security risks].

=== Data and system integrity failures ===
Data integrity failure refers to the situation when the data stored or transmitted by a system is modified or destroyed in an unauthorized or unintended way, resulting in the loss of accuracy, completeness, or consistency of the data. System integrity failure refers to the situation when the system or its components (hardware, software, firmware) are altered or damaged in an unauthorized or unintended way, resulting in the loss of confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the system.

Both types of failures can happen due to various reasons such as data corruption, hacking, software bugs, malware or unauthorized access.

To prevent this type of failures, it is important to follow general security guidelines, but to also make sure that your data is durable by using relevant data replication and backups system in place.

Data and system integrity failures are ranked #8 on https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/[OWASP's top ten web application security risks].

=== Security logging and monitoring failures ===
Security logging and monitoring failures refer to the situation where the logging and monitoring mechanisms used to secure a system fail to provide the level of security that was intended. This can happen due to various reasons such as poor logging configuration, lack of monitoring or alerting, or lack of proper incident response plan.

There are several types of security logging and monitoring failures, including:

* Inadequate logging: This occurs when the system does not log enough data, or does not log the right data, to detect and respond to security incidents.
* Lack of monitoring: This occurs when the system is not monitored for suspicious activity, which can make it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents.
* Lack of alerting: This occurs when the system does not have the capability to alert security personnel when suspicious activity is detected.
* Lack of incident response plan: This occurs when the system does not have a plan in place for responding to security incidents.

To prevent security logging and monitoring failures, it's important to follow these best practices:

* Use of comprehensive logging: Use logging mechanisms that capture a comprehensive set of data, including user actions, system actions, and network activity.
* Use of real-time monitoring: Use monitoring mechanisms that can detect suspicious activity in real-time, such as using intrusion detection systems (IDS) or security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
* Use of alerting mechanisms: Use alerting mechanisms that can notify security personnel when suspicious activity is detected.
* Use of incident response plan: Use incident response plan that outlines steps to be taken in case of security incident.
* Regularly review and audit logs: Regularly review and audit logs to ensure that they are complete and accurate and address any issues that may arise.

Outdated and vulnerable software are ranked #9s on https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/[OWASP's top ten web application security risks].


With all these security concerns in mind, let's get back to Polycode.
