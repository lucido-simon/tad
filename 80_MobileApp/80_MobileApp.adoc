= Adding a mobile app to Polycode =

== Introduction ==
The internet and websites are now mostly accessed through mobile devices. More and more people are letting their laptop in the drawer, using their phone as their only device to access the web. To reach this audience, creating a responsive website is not enough. People expect a native app experience, with a offline mode, push notifications, and a smooth user experience.

However, before diving into how we can integrate a mobile app into the system, I would like to discuss if it really makes sense to do so.
Indeed, I would argue that Polycode functionalities are not suited at all for a mobile user-agent. Coding on a phone is a horrible experience that nobody is willing to endure. Following currently available lessons would also be a pain, since we provide interactive coding environments. It looks like all the current Polycode functionalities are not suited for a mobile app.

To me, justifying a mobile app would only makes sense if you are also providing a new set of functionalities that are mobile friendly.

== What is important ? ==
Let's start by identifying what is important in a mobile app. Users has come to expect some behaviors from mobile applications, and failing to match those behaviors will cause the user to have a bad experience.

=== Offline ===
Although we live in a country (France) where cellular data is really cheap, we need to consider that a lot of people around the world does not have this privilege. Creating an application that relies on being connected at all time may seem not that big of a deal, but in reality, it is.

We need to provide a set of functionalities that are available offline, the goal being to have the same experience whether you're online or not.

==== Sets of contents packaged with the app ====
The first obvious approach is to bundle the application content with the app. This makes the app not reliant on connectivity to work.
However, it comes with its disadvantages. The app is bigger to download, updating content means going through each platform long and painful validation process, which also makes it very difficult to rollback or fix broken updates, we will touch on that later. We don't want the user to update the application everyday for the xref:repetitive[eventual daily content either].

==== Fetch data when possible ====
We can take the opposite approach and not ship anything but the application logic in the app, and download contents whenever the device retrieves connectivity. After all, the user is most likely to open the app right after downloading it, meaning he has connectivity. Moreover, I would argue that the user will need to log in before using any features, guarantying that the app has the ability to download contents before the user needs it.

==== Best of both worlds ? ====
The previous approach looks like the best for the user experience, but it has some issues:

* This increases significantly the load on the infrastructure, for contents that are stable, bug free, known to be working and that is going to be downloaded anyway
* The user might have a very limited bandwidth, which may cause the application to be too data-hungry for them

Mixing both approaches will limit or eliminate their drawbacks, but it is important that it is at the cost of the app complexity.

==== Handling releases ====
The mobile app distribution is controlled by basically two actors (Google and Apple), who both have strict review processes for each applications and each of their updates. This means that relying on updating the application to releases new content or fix mundane bugs becomes a long process, and you need something that can circumvent those limitations.

This is the problem of some frameworks out there, that promises a fast and easy development, for both platform, but actually bundles the rendering engine with the application as well as your application code, meaning that there is no way to update the rendering, except updating the app. This might be a tradeoff you're willing to make, but I don't think it's worth the pain.

On the other side, you can opt to develop an app that is closer to a web view, that can be updated on the fly, without needing to go through the painful verification process of each store. Using the right framework, you can have the same code base (modulo some minors tweaks) for both iOS and Android, while using natives bindings for the rendering, and having views that can be updated on the fly.

With that being said, let's switch to another important aspect of a mobile app.

=== Short in time ===
We want users to be able to use the application as much as possible. This means, the user must be able to spend some time on the application whenever they have a few minutes to spare. By extension, we must give them functionalities and things to do that are short in time and that can be completed within a few minutes, maximum.
This creates an incentive for the user to come to the app when they have a little bit of time to spare, or when they want to take a break of whatever they are doing. This, plus the educational aspect of the application, contributes to fight the feeling of wasting time and procrastination the user might have. 

[#repetitive]
=== Repetitive ===
As an application, you want your users to come back to it as much as possible. What can we do to make our users come back ?

==== Create an habit ====
The first thing that is important to recognize is that for a user to come back, we need them to create a habit. A habit is triggered by an event, and results in the brain associating this event with an action. For example, a smoking student might say that, at every class break (the trigger), he goes smoking (the action).

We need the user to create this kind of habit. To do so, we need to provide something that incentives the creation of this habit, like for examples, daily contents, that is rewarded whenever it's completed, with a system of streak that pushes the user to not miss the next day content.

Deconstructing a habit is hard, harder that it is to create it. Once the user has this habit, we can try to use it as a way to push them towards the desktop application, where more in-depth content is available, and where he can find the full set of functionalities of the application.

==== Push notifications ====
One powerful tool that is available on mobile, are the push notifications. This is a way to remind the user of our daily contents. This might be both the tool that will make the user creates the habit, but also the trigger on which the user will then open the app.

One way of increasing the effectiveness of push notifications, is to time it well. You don't want to send this notifications at 9h30, right after the user got to work. You might want to send this notifications at 7h30 in the morning, while commuting, at 1pm, during lunch break or at 6pm when commuting back from work. This can be fine tuned based on the user behaviors, and might take multiple days for the app to get it right. But creating an algorithm that tries to figure out where the user is most likely to have free time and send that push notification should give a great trade-off between the resources put into creating it, and its reward, although difficult to measures.

== Mobile only ? ==
A concern you might have, is how to integrate these functionalities into the Polycode website ? I would argue that the question is more along the lines of __Do we need to integrate these functionalities into the Polycode website ?__. 

Gate-keeping these functionalities will create an incentive for desktop users to download and use the application. If you're already spending time on the website, pushing them towards another platform where they can interact with our service when they have a little bit of free time, like discussed previously, will not be difficult. This would both increase the time the user interacts with our service, and create new habits so they keep coming using our service. They should not be pushed to aggressively, as this will impact the user experience, and also create a surface for backlash.
I would like to point out that this is mostly a executive decision, and not a technical one. When building the backend for those new features, you should do it in a agnostic manner: any user-agent should be able to interact with it, letting us the possibility to integrate easily other platforms in the future.

== Mobile functionalities ==
As discussed above, to justify a mobile app, we need to provide a new set of functionalities that are mobile friendly, with new contents available daily. Here are some ideas, we will dive into each of them, in details, later in this document :

* Daily short coding lessons
* Daily coding quizzes
* Find the bug


=== Daily coding lessons ===
Fitting into the short-in-time and repetitive constraint we have, I would propose daily coding lessons, which would be short (5 to 10 minutes) lessons the user can follow. You should not have to follow the previous lessons to be able to follow the current one. This might look unintuitive at first, but I think we trade the benefits of having a tailored progression for each user for having a easier to make, broader content that we can really focus on each day.
This would also have the benefits of making it a topic of conversation among the Polycode mobile app users. If the lesson is the same for everybody, it means that they can talk about it every day, discussing the significance of what they learnt and how they can better use it in their life.
However, making unique lessons that have no progression curve might also be boring for the user after a certain time, and finding new interesting content that has not be covered will become more and more difficult over time. This is a trade-off, and we keep the other approach in mind when implementing it, making sure we can easily extend the functionality to be based on the user's level later on. The lessons should be able in offline as well. As soon as the app retrieves connectivity, it will try to download new lessons, which can be published multiple days in advance. This way, the user will always have a lesson to do, even if they are offline for a few days.
To incentivize the user coming back everyday, we should establish a streak system, keeping count of how long you have been doing your daily lessons. The user will not want to lose its streak and try to find time to complete its lesson. I think we should also grant the user Polypoints at different stages of progression, that they can use to buy things in the shop (which is currently only composed of hints for desktop exercises).

=== Daily coding quizzes ===
On the same model as the daily coding lessons, daily coding quizzes would be a small quiz, 5 minutes maximum, that would also be pushed to the user every day. The quiz would relate to the lesson of that day, and have the same streak system than the daily coding lessons. However, they would be pushed later on in the day than the lessons, to make sure the user correctly understood and remembered the lesson of earlier. For every answer, a short explanation of why this was the correct answer should be displayed, even if the user was right.
The quiz should be downloaded when the device retrieves connectivity, ideally at the same time as the lesson.

=== Find the bug ===
The daily contents are a great feature and idea for our mobile app, but we also need contents that is available whenever the user wants to use the app, and not to be limited to the daily content. For a start, we could provide a way to go back in time and catch up the lessons and quizzes missed. But I would also propose a small game, where you are provided a code that is not working and you have to figure out what is the problem.

The idea is simple: show a small sample of code, give some context about what is should be achieving, explain unwanted outcome of the sample of code, and let the user figure out what is wrong.

==== Click on the wrong line ====
The user will try to read the code, and when identifying the faulty line of code that's causing the problem, clicks on it. The user is given 3 tries before losing the game. If the user manages to find the faulty line, a small MCQ appears.

==== Explaining the problem ====
To make sure the user actually understood the problem, he will have to select between 4 explanations of what the faulty line is doing wrong. They will be given one chance to answer correctly, and if they does, they are granted a reward. More in-depth features can be explored, such as using Polypoints to have hints. 
Since the progression is tracked per-user, we can introduce more and more difficult bugs, starting with simple iteration loop, to buffer overflows and dandling pointers.

=== Application flow ===
To better illustrate the ideas I've just talked about, and the overall feel of the application, I've made mockups of the application UI. This is in no way a definitive design, and please forgive me for the not so aesthetic layouts, I'm not a designer. However, it conveys the flow and the feel of the app, and that's what I'm interested about.

==== General layout ====
Before diving into the aforementioned features, we are going to look at what the user is greeted with the first time he opens the application, the connection page:

image::80_MobileApp/80_Layout_Connection.png[]

As you can see, I kept the overall theme and components of the https://polycode.do-2021.fr[web application]. This is great for multiple reasons:

* We keep our overall brand identity
* It makes it easier for users to navigate to and from the web app to the mobile app
* The user will feel less frustration, since it recognizes some images, logos and themes. It will increase conversion rate for users who are already using another platform.
* Less design to do, we only need to adapt existing layout and themes to match the mobile version.

I think that, with some little adjustments, the actual design and graphic identity of Polycode is suited to a mobile app. I think this is further demonstrated by the example of an home page that I've made:

image::80_MobileApp/80_Layout_Home.png[]

At the top, we find a header that will be present all throughout the app. We will see later that, when navigating to the different features, this banner changes to display the part where the user currently is. This helps we navigating the application, even though its very rudimentary. On the main page, we find displayed all of our main features. I've included the mobile-only features that I've mentioned and explained above, as well as a leader board. For the daily lesson, the title of the current one is displayed. For every "daily" features, a tick is shown if the user has finished today's content (like on the daily lesson). A small text is displayed to inform the user about its streak, the text being adapted on whether or not the user has done the content. Find the bug and the leader board are static texts. The main page is very simple, with only the four aforementioned tiles that the user can interact with. As the application grows and more featured are being added, we might want to revisit this display to have a better arrangement, but also include some general information, news, notifications or whatever would make sense on the main page.

We find our purple-accented theme in titles and logos. The logos shown here should be worked on, as they don't feel quite right but they still give a great preview of the objective. 

At the bottom, we find a navigation bar, that, just like the header, will also be displayed all throughout the application. This navbar allows the user to navigate to the main page, the 3 mobile features and also its profile. Those are effectively tabs, that you could switch from one another by tapping icons or by swiping left or right. This is a usual flow in modern portrait application that have different features, such as Snapchat or Instagram, that the user should already be familiar with.

Now that we have seen the general layout, let's take a look at all our mobile features !

==== Daily lessons ====
Introducing to you, our daily lessons user interface:

image::80_MobileApp/80_Layout_Daily_Lesson.png[]

As you can see, it's actually pretty simple. The main goal here is to display text properly for a phone format. This is just a scrollable article, that can integrate small pieces of code, but the gist of it will be text organized with parts. We need to define a layout and style consistent across all our daily lessons, to give a easier reading experience for the user on the long-term.

* The title of the lesson is at the top, centered, in a bigger font size.
* The title of a section is displayed in Polycode's purple, also centered.
* Paragraph is written in black. Important word are in bold.
* Code can be formatted within paragraph, the styling must be consistent.
* The font should always be the same (the same that everywhere on the app).
* References to other lessons (or external sources) should simply be underlined.

A discrete scrollbar is present on the right, and is persistent. Making it persistent allows the user to be able to judge where in the lesson he currently is, without much inconveniences.

Once again, this is a pretty simple page. Let's move on to the next feature.

==== Daily quiz ====
In a logical manner, I will now show you and discuss what my mockup for the daily quizzes is:

image::80_MobileApp/80_Layout_Daily_Quiz.png[]

As explained before, we find our navigation bar at the bottom and our header stating that we are in the daily quiz at the top. The main content is divided in two parts: the question and the answers. For this quiz, the question includes a code sample. The user is asked to explain what will be printed to the console.
The code needs to be big enough that its comfortable to read on a phone, and the size used here is big enough, since it is about the same font size as the main font size in the application. I used rounded corners for a better feel for both the code window and the answers, to make the application feel less boxy.
The answers needs to be separated from one another to leave as little room as possible for user accidental pressing on the wrong answer. This is why I've used all the space possible in the window. 
We must not forget that the quiz does not necessarily include a code sample, but since the daily lessons and daily quizzes are related, this quiz made sense, and allows me to show you what code samples would look like. The overall layout should be following the same rules as for the daily lessons, but can be tailored to fit a particular use case. 

Don't forget that what I show you are suggestions. I'm not a designer and the final layout and styling could be different. With that said, let's move on to our last mobile feature.

==== Find the bug ====
As explained previously, find the bug is a small integrated game where the user is explained a problem with a piece of code. They then click on the faulty line, where a question about what the problem actually is is shown, where they have to demonstrate their understanding of the problem. Here's a mockup for the first part: 

image::80_MobileApp/80_Layout_FTB_1.png[]

It is also a pretty simple page. There is a description of the problem at the top. In this case, we have a segmentation fault somewhere in our code. Right below it, is the piece of code that is responsible of the problem. It is displayed in a similar way that what we say in the daily quiz, except that the line spacing is way larger. This is due to the fact that the user needs to click on the line. It means we need to format the code in a way that make it adapted for this use case. With the spacing shown in this example, the user should have no problem touching the line he wants to touch, without worrying about pressing the wrong line by accident.

Once the user clicks on the faulty line, the user is taken to the next step, displayed on a new page:

image::80_MobileApp/80_Layout_FTB_2.png[]

At the top of the main content, we have a reminder of what the user clicked on. The user can validate that it is indeed the line he thought he clicked. But more importantly, we need to show it here so he can better inspect the faulty line. Some feedback would be needed to see if users feel like they need to have the whole code sample to better contextualize the faulty line. For now, I've decided it was not needed.

Just below, we find the question that verifies that the user understood why it was faulty. It is in the same form, with the same layout and the same styling as with the daily quiz.

Let's now look at the endpoints that needs to be implemented in the backend for our features to work.
=== API ===

== Authentication ==
=== Requirements ===
The typical mobile user has come to expect a smooth user experience, with a native app feel. This means that we need to provide a login experience that is as smooth as possible.

==== Keeping the user logged in ====
One of the main behavior users expect, is not to have to login every time they open the app. All the the application you use daily, even those who might be sensitive, does not require logging in after the initial setup. 
We want the user to access the application as fast as possible, and logging in is a barrier to that. Moreover, this would cause a displeasing experience for the user, entering your credentials is not fun.

We need to find a way to make sure the user needs to log in only once.

==== Not storing the password ====
With that being said, one big requirement we need to respect is not to store the user's password at all. Doing so is a big security risk if their device were to be compromised, albeit by a malicious actor or by someone gaining physical access to the device. This is harmful to the user, since he might be reusing this password elsewhere, but also for us, since the attacker have access to the whole account, not only the session in the application.
