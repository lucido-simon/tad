= UI Integration =

== Introduction ==
Throughout this whole paper, I have been talking a lot about the migration of Polycode from a monolithic backend towards a microservice architecture. We have solved a lot of problems related to this migration, and have resolved a lot concerns we had prior to this migration. However, this shifts in mentality and paradigm in the backend raises multiple questions about how we can keep a UI that is closely integrated with the backend, in a way that is transparent for the end-user ?

In this section, I'm going to talk about the side-effects this migration might have on the web UI, and more importantly, if we should shift our way of thinking and developing the UI into something that fits better our new architecture.

=== How does the UI relates to the backend ? ===
An important question that we must ask ourselves, is how does the frontend interacts with the backend. After all, your web UI is where all your hard work that you put in your backend microservices are going to be used, and a poorly integrated UI will spoil everything. The frontend of your application is where the end users journey begin. It should be seen as an integral part of your system.

Currently in Polycode, both the backend and the frontend are developed in a monolithic manner. This is what we thought would be the organization fits the project the best, given that we are a small team and could coordinate pretty easily. At the beginning, we separated ourselves into 3 smaller teams: the backend team, the frontend team and the operational team. We realized during the first few months of the project that is was not the best organization to have, since each team was not implicated well-enough in the overall end-product, and we lost the goal and instead focused on technical decisions.

This is where we switched towards a more product-oriented approach, where we divided ourselves into 2 teams. However, instead of having each team responsible of a different stack, each team was responsible of a different products. One team would be responsible for implementing the candidates invite system for example, from the frontend to the backend. This has, for now, improved the overall code quality, and implication of the team, although it is too early to state that this is a definitive improvement. However, it makes much more sense to think like that, and allows for teams to focus on the end goal.

I think this is the direction we need to take going forward, and this is further exacerbated by the migration towards microservices, whose one of the main benefits is to allow a fine division of responsibilities, where small team can be fully responsible of an element in your domain and contexts. This is especially fitting in larger project, and Polycode is starting to become one. Now, one team can be responsible to developing a whole product, owning their own microservice, their own database, and their own frontend.. Or not quite yet.

Indeed, we saw this shift in paradigm in how we handle our backend development, operation management and project organization. The last piece of this puzzle that has not yet evolved to match this new way of organizing our development is the frontend. Actually, a team owns a microservice, owns its database, but share the frontend. This will lead to inevitable collisions, and we need to find a way to either work around this problem or completely eliminate it.

I hope that it all makes sense to you on an organizational standpoint, but it might still not be clear how this will improve the end-user's experience.

=== The end user experience ===
There are several ways this will improve the end-user experience.

First off, let's talk about the feature release schedule. By eliminating coordination and collision concerns between teams, each team can fully focus on developing its part of the application. This will improve the speed at which each team can develop their features, and reduce the time spent on fixing bugs and integrations concerns with the other part of the system. By speeding up this process, the end-user can expect to have features developed more efficiently, and by extension, have new features released more often. 

Secondly, as mentioned above, developing the frontend using the same paradigms as with microservices will lead to fewer bugs, since the applications can be developed in a isolated manner, not worrying about other parts of the system. This will free up more time for the developers to work on other things, since they won't have to chase side-effects of pieces of code that was written by another team 6 months ago, but also generally reduce the number of bugs that slip through the crack and end up on the production environment.

=== Polycode ===
This all looks good on paper, even though we haven't considered the drawbacks yet. But I want to take a moment and stop to think wether or not it really makes sense to shifts towards a more microservice-oriented way to compose our frontend.

Our current frontend stack is a NextJS application. The frontend is rapidly growing in size, and we have gained a significant technical debt due some poor decisions we made. However, this is slowly being addressed by some members of the team to try to scoop off some of this debt. I would still think that a complete overhaul of the underlying way we manage our frontend would be beneficial, but we can keep most of our components as is.

It is still totally workable, and we must keep in mind that there are usually not more than two features being implemented in the frontend at the same time, something that will not move in time, since the team can only shrink in size. We have the problems of side-effects and integrating correctly with other parts of the frontend, but this is not a big problem at the moment.

Another key point is that, with the page-based routing of NextJS, we actually a basic way to divide our application into multiple parts. We sort of already have the possibility to work the way described above, considering the size of the team and of the codebase. I would argue that we have bigger concerns today.

However, it is interesting to explore the solutions we can adopt, that would allows us to develop in a way that totally decouples each UI Parts, effectively thinking of the frontend the same way we now think about the backend, using a microservice architecture.

== Micro frontends ==
An emerging pattern that is currently trying to answer the same problems that the microservice architecture, but for frontend application, is the micro frontends architecture. As the name implies, it revolves around the same concept as microservices: divide your frontend code into smaller, independent and decoupled applications. There are multiple ways to achieve this goal, I will try to dive into each of them, but they all try to solve the same problem: allow team to work simultaneously on a large and complex product, by breaking them into much more manageable pieces of code.

Let's dive into the main way to achieve this, starting with server-side template composition.

=== Server-side template composition ===
Server-side template composition refers the process of combining multiple micro-frontends into a single page on the server side before sending the final HTML to the browser. This allows for the integration of different micro-frontends into a cohesive user interface, while still allowing each micro-frontend to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This approach can also improve the performance and SEO of the application by reducing the amount of JavaScript needed to be loaded on the client side. This approach tries to mix the server side rendering (SSR) approach of meta-framework like NextJS, and the micro-frontend architecture. This achieves similar benefits of server side rendering.

Unlike with classic SSR, this is done by having a "container" server, which is the server that a user-agent will hit when requesting a website. This container server will then compose the page by fetching each necessary piece of the HTML template to the responsible micro frontend server. This approach focus on reducing the payload size sent to the client, by rendering the page on the server, but also significantly improves SEO (Search engine optimization, how well your site is ranked by search engines), since search engines crawlers still have limited ways to execute Javascript, which is why SPAs are usually not well ranked by search engines.

This approach totally decouples each of your micro-frontends, but sharing data between your micro-frontends becomes a very difficult task. You might argue that with a micro-frontend approach, this should not happen, but in reality there is always a need for sharing some kind of data or message from one micro frontend to another, for example the logged in user.

This approach allows for nested micro-frontend servers, where the container server would fetch data from another server, which itself fetches data from another server. This is great when breaking down features, but can increase the time needed to render a page. You need to carefully design a robust caching system when using this pattern, else the time to first byte to the end-user can quickly get out of hand.

=== Run-time integration ===
Runtime integration in a micro-frontend context refers to the process of combining multiple micro-frontends into a single page at runtime, in the browser, rather than on the server-side. This allows for a more dynamic and interactive user interface, as the different micro-frontends can communicate with each other and update in real-time.

You can integrate your micro-frontend in a myriad of ways, but we will focus on two of them in this chapter: Javascript bundles, and Web components.

However, runtime integration also has some limitations, such as increased complexity in managing the client-side code, and potential issues with SEO and performance if not implemented correctly. It's also worth noting that runtime integration requires a more powerful client-side, while server-side integration is more SEO friendly and can work with less powerful clients.

==== Javascript bundles ====
With this approach, each micro-frontend is loaded as a separate JavaScript bundle and runs independently in the browser. The micro-frontends communicate with each other through a shared event bus or a message-passing mechanism. The micro-frontends can also be loaded and unloaded dynamically, depending on the user's interactions with the application.

There should be a container Javascript runtime, which will be responsible for fetching the correct Javascript bundle when needed. This allows for islands of interactivity, and the loading and unloading of bundles depending on the user interactions with the web page. This is a similar approach as the island patterns that frameworks like https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/[Astro] use.

This approach has several benefits:

* Dynamic updates: Micro-frontends can communicate with each other and update the user interface in real-time, providing a more dynamic and interactive user experience.
* Flexibility: Micro-frontends can be developed, deployed and scaled independently, providing more flexibility for teams working on different parts of the application.
* Improved performance: Since the majority of the code is loaded on demand, only the necessary micro-frontends are loaded, reducing the initial load time and improving the performance of the application.

However, this approach is the heaviest on the client, since it requires executing a lot of Javascript. If you need to have a good SEO, this might not be the right approach either, since a lot of additional work will be required to have an initial HTML placeholder, while the Javascript downloads and execute. Moreover, you need to carefully manage your dependencies. If each of your micro frontends depends on React to function, you don't want to download this dependency on the browser everytime a micro-frontends loads.

==== Web Components ====
Web components are a set of technologies that allow developers to create custom, reusable elements for use in HTML pages. These custom elements can be treated just like any other HTML element, and can be used to encapsulate the functionality of a micro-frontend.

When using web components for runtime integration, each micro-frontend is implemented as a custom element. These custom elements can be loaded and unloaded dynamically, allowing for a more flexible and dynamic user interface. The micro-frontends can also communicate with each other through a shared event bus or a message-passing mechanism, allowing for real-time updates to the user interface.

* Reusability: Web components are reusable and can be used across different parts of the application, reducing code duplication and making it easier to maintain the application.
* Isolation: Web components provide a high level of isolation between the different micro-frontends, ensuring that changes to one micro-frontend do not affect the others.
* Interoperability: Web components are built on standard web technologies and are compatible with other web technologies and frameworks, making it easy to integrate them into existing applications.
* Browser support: Web components are supported by modern browsers, so this approach can be used in most web environments.

However, web components do require a more powerful client-side and may have a steeper learning curve for developers not familiar with the technology. Additionally, web components have a slightly different way of handling browser events and styling compared to traditional HTML, and may require additional setup and configuration.

== Conclusion ==
Micro-frontend are a growing force in the web development industry, allowing for organizations to adopt a product-oriented approach for their team for the entirety of the stack, including the frontend, backend and operation layer. They bring similar advantages and drawbacks as with a microservice architecture, meaning that most teams and organizations that had the time to experiment with a microservice architecture probably found their way to gain as much value from them, while mitigating the drawbacks. They might use this knowledge to migrate towards a micro-frontend architecture, if they find their frontend to be too hard to maintain and to work on collaboratively.

However, just like with the microservice architecture, it is important to recognize that it is not a one-fit-all solution, and to adopting them means that you have carefully considered all the other options. If you don't have the necessity to switch to a micro-frontend architecture, I would advise against it. This will just add the burden of maintaining this kind of architecture without benefiting from it, which is obviously a bad idea.

I would argue that this is the case for Polycode. Our current organization allows us to proceed in a product-oriented manner, even in the frontend, although it is still a "monolithic frontend". However, we don't have enough teams and members working on the project to really gain from micro-frontend. I would suggest continuing handling the UI of Polycode the way we do it currently.
